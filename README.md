# E-Commerce-Data-Analysis-Project
This project simulates a real-world e-commerce data analysis scenario. It covers the entire data workflow from data generation using Python to data cleaning in SQL, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) and dashboarding using Microsoft Power BI. The goal is to derive actionable business insights from a custom-built dataset.
